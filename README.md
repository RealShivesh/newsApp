# NEWS App using React Native

## This app has been created using React Native as a part of my Krypto Assignment.

## Assignment goals

1. Create a basic layout design and bottom navbar

- Make a bottom navigation bar for
  - Home screen
  - Search screen
  - Job screen

These tasks are done.

2. Fetch the APIs from hackernews to display the news and the jobs

Issues I am facing right now:

- The fetch API for the hackernews API has two ways:
  - The stories display the ID numbers
  - The stories and jobs are fetched through the ID numbers
  - SO I need to store the array with numbers somewhere, and then display them to the jobs or news section.
- The icons aren't being displayed on the Tab icons.
  - The icons need to be re-verified again.

3. Style the complete app.
4. Deploy the app and make the APK.
